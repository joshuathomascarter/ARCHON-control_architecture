Entropy Override FSM Pathway
This document outlines the signal pathway and control logic for ARCHON's entropy-guided FSM override system. It includes:

FSM Flow: Transitions between STALL, FLUSH, LOCK, and OK states

Integration: How ML outputs are combined with low-level Verilog signals

Purpose: Enables intelligent hazard handling in hybrid CPU architectures
